# Test-Driven Development Demo

There are three main operations in the task.py file that was made in collaboration with two others
for the final Python TDD assignment for a software development course. My responsibility was in creating
a testable method that was capable of converting any integers into either little or big-endian bytestrings.

In a couple short hours I wrote 31 tests ensuring complete coverage and successfully passed them all, I then
wrote a method that successfully demonstrated the logic needed to convert Epoch Time (Unix time -> the number
of elapsed seconds since Jan 1, 1970) into a standard human-readable datetime that a group member failed to
incorporate.
